We show that during Iterative DPO training that not only does instruction following ability improve, but also the ability to provide high-quality rewards to itself.\n\nOur approach first assumes access to a base pretrained language model, and a small amount of human-annotated seed data. We then build a model that aims to possess two skills simultaneously: 1. Instruction following: given a prompt that describes a user request, the ability to generate a high quality, helpful (and harmless) response. 2. Self-Instruction creation: the ability to generate and evaluate new instruction following examples to add to its own training set.\nWhile we report the results of both approaches in our experiments, we find that learning from preference pairs gives superior performance, and hence recommend that approach.\n\nIterative Training Our overall procedure trains a series of models M1, . . . , MT where each successive model t uses augmented training data created by the t − 1 th model. We thus define AIFT(Mt) to mean AI Feedback Training data created using model Mt. Model Sequence We thus define the models, and the training data they use as follows: M0 : Base pretrained LLM with no fine-tuning. M1 : Initialized with M0, then fine-tuned on the IFT+EFT seed data using SFT. M2 : Initialized with M1, then trained with AIFT(M1) data using DPO. M3 : Initialized with M2, then trained with AIFT(M2) data using DPO.\n\n[In-Context Pretraining] Language Modeling Beyond Document Boundaries🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10638 30 Nov 2023 Meta\nWe instead present IN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING, a new approach where language models are pretrained on a sequence of related documents, thereby explicitly encouraging them to read and reason across document boundaries.\nIN-CONTEXT PRETRAINING instead reorders the pretraining data by combining several semantically related documents to create a coherent input context, thereby exposing LMs to long relevant contexts and providing pretraining signals beyond document boundaries.\nHowever, this document sorting problem is challenging. LMs are typically trained on billions of\ndocuments and we would like to sort them to maximize document similarity in the input context\nwindows without repeating any data. We introduce two new approximate algorithms to tackle these challenges.\n\nTechniques are using embedding models and top-k similarity search and leveraging approximate solutions for the traveling salesman problem - by the means of visiting every document once.\n[DPO] Direct Preference Optimization: Your LM is Secretly a Reward Model🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290 13 Dec 2023 Stanford\nIn this paper we introduce a new parameterization of the reward model in RLHF that enables extraction of the corresponding optimal policy in closed form, allowing us to solve the standard RLHF problem with only a simple classification loss. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant, and computationally lightweight,\neliminating the need for sampling from the LM during fine-tuning or performing significant hyperparameter tuning.\n\nDPO gradient for loss increases the likelihood of preferred completion (Y_W) and decreases the likelihood for dispreferred completion (Y_L). Importantly, the examples are weighed by how much higher the implicit reward model rˆθ rates the dispreferred completions, scaled by β, i.e, how incorrectly the implicit reward model orders the completions, accounting for the strength of the KL constraint. \nDPO outline. The general DPO pipeline is as follows: 1) Sample completions y1, y2 ∼ πref(· | x) for every prompt x, label with human preferences to construct the offline dataset of preferences D = {x (i) , y (i) w , yl) (i)} N i=1 and 2) optimize the language model πθ to minimize LDPO for the given πref and D and desired β. \n[RLHF] Secrets of RLHF in LLMs Part II: Reward Modeling🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15503 24 Dec 2023 Fudan NLP\nIn conclusion, while RLHF is a significant advancement in AI development, particularly in integrating human preferences into the learning process, it also presents unique challenges. These include the inherent noise and ambiguity in human feedback, potential biases in the data, and the generalization limits of reward models trained on specific datasets. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the advancement and ethical application of RLHF in AI systems.\n\nTo enhance the generalization ability of the reward model, we explore contrastive learning and\nmeta-learning. By introducing unsupervised contrastive loss during the reward modeling process, the reward model can better distinguish subtle preference differences among responses. To bridge the gap between the preference data distribution and the model output distribution, we employ meta-learning to ensure that the reward model not only performs well on the preference data but also can distinguish the differences in target domain outputs.\nTechnique is to randomize training data and do a k-fold split, build K models and then measure mean and deviations - negative mean is usually the mistakes. \nAccording to the results, we can observe that: 1) For the top 20% of data with the lowest preference strength, they have a negative impact on the model’s performance on the validation set. The preference strength for these data subsets is less than 0. 2) For data ranked between 20% and 40%, after training, the model’s prediction accuracy on the validation set is approximately 0.5. The preference strength for this type of data is around 0. 3) The remaining data significantly improves the model’s performance. However, the top 10% of data with the highest preference strength does not achieve the best performance when trained alone. Based on the above results, we can roughly categorize preference data into three types: incorrect data, ambiguous data (almost no difference), and normal data (clear differences). These three types of preference data play different roles and make different contributions to preference modeling. It is necessary for us to conduct a more detailed analysis of them and then consider how to handle each type.\n[LLARA] Making LLMs A Better Foundation For Dense Retrieval🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06080 11 Jan 2024 Beijing Academy of AI\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach, called LLaRA (LLM adapted for dense RetrievAl), which works as a post-hoc adaptation of LLM for the dense retrieval application. LLaRA consists of two pretext tasks: EBAE (Embedding-Based Auto-Encoding) and EBAR (Embedding-Based Auto-Regression), where the text embeddings from LLM are used to reconstruct the tokens for the input sentence and predict the tokens for the next sentence, respectively\n\nParticularly, there are two pretext training tasks introduced by LLaRA: EBAE (Embedding-Based Auto-Encoding) and EBAR (Embedding-Based Auto-Regression). In EBAE, the LLM is prompted to generate the text embeddings, which can be used to predict the tokens for the input sentence itself. While with EBAR, the LLM is prompted to generate the text embeddings, which can be used to predict the  tokens for the next sentence.

The key idea is to encode relative position by multiplying the context representations with a rotation matrix with a clear theoretical interpretation.\n[LORA] LOw-RAnk Adaptation of LLM🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685 17 Jun 2021 OpenAI\nMany applications in natural language processing rely on adapting one large-scale, pre-trained language model to multiple downstream applications. Such adaptation is usually done via fine-tuning,\nwhich updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model. The major downside of fine-tuning is that the new model contains as many\nparameters as in the original model.\nMany sought to mitigate this by adapting only some parameters or learning external modules for new tasks. This way, we only need to store and load a small number of task-specific parameters in addition to the pre-trained model for each task, greatly boosting the operational efficiency when deployed. However, existing techniques often introduce inference latency by extending model depth or reducing the model’s usable sequence length. More importantly, these methods often fail to match the fine-tuning baselines, posing a trade-off between efficiency and model quality.\n[Speculative] Fast Inference from Transformers via Speculative Decoding🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17192 30 Nov 2022 Google\nThe key observation above, that some inference steps are “harder” and some are “easier”, is also a key motivator for our work. We additionally observe that inference from large models is often not bottlenecked on arithmetic operations, but rather on memory bandwidth and communication, so additional computation resources might be available.\nTherefore we suggest increasing concurrency as a complementary approach to using an adaptive amount of computation. Specifically, we are able to accelerate inference without changing the model architectures, without changing the training-procedures or needing to re-train the models, and without changing the model output distribution. This is accomplished via speculative execution.\n\n[GQA] Training Generalized Multi-Query Transformer Models from Multi-Head Checkpoints🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13245 22 May 2023 Google\n\n[Multi-Heads Sharing]Fast Transformer Decoding: One Write-Head is All You Need🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150 6 Nov 2019  Google\nMulti-head attention layers, as used in the Transformer neural sequence model, are a powerful alternative to RNNs for moving information across and between sequences. While training these layers is generally fast and simple, due to parallelizability across the length of the sequence, incremental inference (where such parallelization is impossible) is often slow, due to the memory-bandwidth cost of repeatedly loading the large \"keys'' and \"values\" tensors. We propose a variant called multi-query attention, where the keys and values are shared across all of the different attention \"heads\", greatly reducing the size of these tensors and hence the memory bandwidth requirements of incremental decoding. We verify experimentally that the resulting models can indeed be much faster to decode, and incur only minor quality degradation from the baseline.\nWe introduce multi-query Attention as a variation of multi-head attention as described in [Vaswani et al., 2017]. Multi-head attention consists of multiple attention layers (heads) in parallel with different linear transformations on the queries, keys, values and outputs. Multi-query attention is identical except that the different heads share a single set of keys and values.\n[MoE] Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-Of-Experts Layer🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06538 23 Jan 2017 Google\nThe capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by its number of\nparameters. Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a\nper-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In practice,\nHowever, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges. In this\nwork, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional\ncomputation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with\nonly minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to\nthousands of feed-forward sub-networks. A trainable gating network determines\na sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. \nWe present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers. On large language modeling and machine translation benchmarks, these models achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art at lower computational cost.\n[MoE] Mixture-of-Experts Meets Instruction Tuning: A Winning Combination for LLM🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14705 24 May 2023 Google\nSparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a neural architecture design that can be utilized to add learnable parameters to Large Language Models (LLMs) without increasing inference cost. \n","id":"https://gel.github.io/generative-ai/2-llm-research/3-llm-optimization/","title":"LLM Optimization"},"https://gel.github.io/generative-ai/2-llm-research/4-llm-prompting/":{"body":"LLM Prompting - In-Context-Learning🔗\n[MedPrompt] Can Generalist Foundation Models Outcompete Special-Purpose Tuning? Case Study in Medicine🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16452 28 Nov 2023 Microsoft\nWe find that prompting innovation can unlock deeper specialist capabilities and show that GPT-4 easily tops prior leading results for medical benchmarks.\nWe find that GPT-4 benefits significantly from being allowed to design its prompt, specifically with coming up with its own chain-of-thought to be used for in-context learning. This observation echoes other reports that GPT-4 has an emergent self-improving capability via introspection, such as self-verification\nWe note that the automated chain-of-thought reasoning removes dependency on special human expertise and medical datasets. Thus, despite the name Medprompt, extending from the framing context and research trajectory of our investigation of the capabilities of GPT-4 on medical challenge problems, the methodology doesn’t include any components specifically oriented towards medicine.\nEnsembling is a technique for combining the outputs of multiple model runs to arrive at a more robust or accurate result via combining the separate outputs with functions like averaging, consensus, or majority vote. Ensembling methods employing a technique referred to as self-consistency [32] use a sampling method to produce multiple outputs that are then consolidated to identify a consensus output. The diversity of the outputs can be controlled by shifting the “temperature” parameter in a model’s generation, where higher temperatures can be viewed as injecting greater amounts of randomness into the generation process. By reordering or shuffling components of a few-shot prompt, ensembling techniques can also address the order sensitivity commonly found with foundation models [26, 39], thus improving robustness.\n\nA key challenge with this approach is that self-generated CoT rationales have an implicit risk of including hallucinated or incorrect reasoning chains. We mitigate this concern by having GPT-4 generate both a rationale and an estimation of the most likely answer to follow from that reasoning chain. If this answer does not match the ground truth label, we discard the sample entirely, under the assumption that we cannot trust the reasoning. While hallucinated or incorrect reasoning can still yield the correct final answer (i.e. false positives), we found that this simple label-verification step acts as an effective filter for false negatives.\nWhile less severe than other foundation models, GPT-4 can exhibit a propensity to favor certain options in multiple choice answers over others (regardless of the option content), i.e., the model can show position bias [1, 16, 40]. To reduce this bias, we propose shuffling the choices and then checking consistency of the answers for the different sort orders of the multiple choice. As a result, we perform choice shuffle and self-consistency prompting. Self-consistency [32] replaces the naive single-path or greedy decoding with a diverse set of reasoning paths when prompted multiple times at some temperature&gt; 0, a setting that introduces a degree of randomness in generations. With choice shuffling, we shuffle the relative order of the answer choices before generating each reasoning path. We then select the most consistent answer, i.e., the one that is least sensitive to choice shuffling.\n\n[URIAL] The Unlocking Spell on Base LLMs: Rethinking Alignment via In-Context Learning🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01552 _ 4 Dec 2023 **Allen Institute **_\nURIAL (Untuned LLMs with Restyled In-context ALignment). Based on these findings, we rethink the alignment of LLMs by posing the research question: how effectively can we align base LLMs without SFT or RLHF? To address this, we introduce a simple, tuning-free alignment method, URIAL. URIAL achieves effective alignment purely through in-context learning (ICL) with base LLMs, requiring as few as three constant stylistic examples and a system prompt\nOn the other hand, a recent study, LIMA (Zhou et al., 2023), proposes the “Superficial Alignment Hypothesis,” which argues that alignment tuning might simply teach base LLMs to select a sub distribution of data formats for interacting with users. Zhou et al. (2023) demonstrates that SFT with as few as 1,000 examples can also yield high-quality aligned models, thus providing indirect support for this hypothesis.\nWe analyze the effect of alignment tuning by examining the token distribution shift between base LLMs and their aligned counterpart (e.g., Llama-2 and Llama2-chat). Our findings reveal that base LLMs and their alignment-tuned versions perform nearly identically in decoding on the majority of token positions (i.e., they share the top-ranked tokens). Most distribution shifts occur with stylistic tokens (e.g., discourse markers, safety disclaimers). These direct evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that alignment tuning primarily learns to adopt the language style of AI assistants, and that the knowledge required for answering user queries predominantly comes from the base LLMs themselves.\n\n\n\n\nURIAL encourages stylistic outputs for ICL examples and a system prompt for in-context alignment.\n[CoVE] Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucinations in LLM Models🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495 25 Sep 2023 Meta\nWe develop the Chain-of-Verification (COVE) method whereby the model first (i) drafts an initial response; then (ii) plans verification questions to fact-check its draft; (iii) answers those questions independently so the answers ar`ze not biased by other responses; and (iv) generates its final verified response.\nThe hallucination problem can be exacerbated due to the issue of exposure bias (Wang &amp; Sennrich, 2020).\n\n","id":"https://gel.github.io/generative-ai/2-llm-research/4-llm-prompting/","title":"LLM Prompting"},"https://gel.github.io/generative-ai/2-llm-research/5-llm-benchmarks/":{"body":"[Benchmark] Generating Benchmarks for Factuality Evaluation of Language Models🔗\nArxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06908 13 Jul 2023  AI21 Labs\nThe key idea is automatically perturbing factual statements taken from the corpus to create a constant number of false variations (hereafter, 3) for each true statement (Figure 1).

Our approach, coined DPOK, integrates policy optimization with KL regularization.\nGeneration of more data includes generating n-1 negative samples and leveraging contrastive loss and generating more images to increase diversity.\nIn fine-tuning the loss function will be the expectancy of the sum of all the binary-human-classified dataset and also loss from the pre-training based data (weighted with B) to maintain accuracy of the model (avoid catastrophic forgetting).

Otherwise, add the &gt; key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, &gt; evict the least recently used key.\nThe functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.\n\nExplanation\nLRU cache is a challenging problem, the problem is mostly focused on how to store the keys efficiently for removal by time inserted. Therefore in addition to the k/v hashtable we need an additional data-structure that allows retrieval, deletion and modification. Heap / Tree based solution are all applicable solutions but requires O(Log(N)) for insertion and removal.\nIn this problem it is possible to do a constant time when choosing a doubly linked list which allows to add to head and evicti from tail.

Checking palindrome is O(N) and all substrings are O(N^2) - therefore O(N^3).\nThis problem can be converted to a dynamic programming problem where Palindrome(i, j) = Palindrome(i+1, j-1) &amp;&amp; s[i] == s[j] (same for odd and even cases). This will require O(N^2) time and O(N^2) memory.\nThere is a simpler way to think about this problem.

However, many engineers underestimate the difficulty of system design and rely on insufficient resources that often provide misleading guidance. \nIn my experience, both free and paid system design trainings frequently miss the mark on adequately preparing candidates. Therefore, in this blog, I will walk through solutions to common system design interview questions, sharing the approach and techniques I've found most effective.\nRecommended System Design Process🔗\n\n\nListen closely to thoroughly understand all requirements before proposing any solutions. Practice active listening and asking clarifying questions at appropriate times. Document requirements clearly on a whiteboard or paper. \n\n\nOnly after requirements are fully defined, begin architecting the high-level design. Explain considerations like expected users, requests per second, latency limits, storage volumes, etc.\n\n\nMap out key architectural components and core data flows end-to-end (e.g user clicks button, client-side call, load balancer, authentication, backend service A, etc.)\n\n\nDeconstruct each component further specifying detailed APIs, data schemas, databases, caching, etc. as needed.\n\n\nKey Strategies🔗\n\n\nAvoid jumping to solutions prematurely before nailing down requirements. Build trust by demonstrating care and precision. \n\n\nKnow when to ask probing questions to unblock progress versus nodding along.\n\n\nBalance high-level architecture with lower-level implementation details at appropriate junctures.\n\n\nWith a structured, requirements-focused approach and strong communication skills, system design interviews can be mastered through practice over time. I look forward to sharing specific techniques for top technology companies' system design questions in future posts.\n","id":"https://gel.github.io/interviews/4-system-design/","title":"Mastering
