Haidt makes a compelling case about the dangers of unrestricted smartphone and social media access for children, backed by extensive research showing alarming increases in youth mental health issues since 2010. While the book effectively demonstrates how digital technology is rewiring childhood development and offers some practical solutions (like delaying smartphone access until age 16), it could have made its points more concisely. The comprehensive research is valuable for parents and educators, but the lengthy format might deter some readers from absorbing its important message about protecting children in the digital age.
Key takeaway: Smartphones and social media are significantly harming youth mental health - we need to act now to protect our kids.
