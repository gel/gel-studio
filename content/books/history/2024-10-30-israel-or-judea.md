Within the apocalyptic reality we've been thrown into over the last two years, "Israel or Judah" offers a deep, comprehensive, and external explanation of the events that are stirring us all. Sefi Rachlevsky presents readers with a systematic and flowing analysis of the political and social changes that have occurred in Israel in recent years. The book exposes the growing power of messianic and racist forces in Israel and their destructive influence on the management of the war we are in, as well as the threat they pose to Israeli democracy.

"Israel or Judah" is a call to action and deep understanding of the processes unfolding in the country and identifying the dangers lurking if steps are not taken to protect its democratic values. The book reminds us of the importance of standing firm and collective mobilization, which alone can defeat the destructive forces from within.

Sefi Rachlevsky is a well-known and respected researcher, author, and publicist who has long acted as a sharp critic of anti-democratic trends in Israel. His bestselling book "The Messiah's Donkey," published in 1998, is considered a prophetic book that predicted many of the core problems Israel faces today.
